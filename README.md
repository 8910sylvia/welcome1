#Personal Introduction Program
 Project Overview and Objectives
This project is a Python-based command-line application designed to interact with users by collecting their personal details and generating a customized welcome message. The objective was to practice handling standard Input/Output (I/O) operations in Python.
Setup and Installation Instructions
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-intro.git
Run the Program: Navigate to the folder and run the script using the terminal:python personal_intro.py
code structure explanation:
Input Phase: The program uses the input() function to prompt the user for data.

Storage: The data is assigned to specific variables (name, age, hobby).

Output Phase: The print() function utilizes f-strings (formatted string literals) to combine the stored variables with static text to create a friendly message.

techinal requirements:
Use input(): Used three times to collect name, age, and hobby.

Use variables: Created name, age, and hobby variables to store the user's responses.

Use print(): Used to display the initial prompts and the final formatted welcome message.

Through this project, I learned how to:

Capture user data from the command line using input().

Store information in variables for later use.

Format strings dynamically using Python f-strings to create natural-sounding sentences.

Structure a GitHub repository with proper documentation.
